## What is this?
This fork includes optimizations oriented towards large servers. Whether you have large amounts of players, entities, or chunks, we'll try to keep your server running as smoothly as can be!

## Downloads
The latest JAR file can be downloaded from [the downloads page][downloads]. You can also clone this repository and build it yourself.

You can find experimental builds of Airplane [here][experimental].

## Will Airplane work with my plugins?
Airplane will work with any plugin that works on Tuinity and Paper. If the plugin uses specific server code, we'll try our best to maintain compatibility, though issues may arise. If you find any plugin compatibility issues, feel free to make a support ticket and report the problems!

## Can you include patches from Tuinity/Paper?
Airplane is a fork of Tuinity, which itself is a fork of Paper. As such, Airplane contains all performance and gameplay optimizations from Paper and Tuinity.

## Support
**How do I get support?**  
We currently require Discord for support. You can go to the `#help` channel to get support from the community. If you're a [patron][patreon], or you boost our Discord server, you can access premium support by reacting to the message in the `#support` channel. You can join the Discord by [clicking this link][discord]!

**What kind of support do you provide?**  
We'll provide support for setting up and configuring Airplane, as well as diagnosing performance issues. If we need to optimize Airplane for a specific use-case, we can do that as well. If you need optimizations related to plugins, our development team is ready to take on any challenge!
