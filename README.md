## "Will Airplane work with my plugins?"
Airplane will work with any plugin that works on Tuinity and Paper. If the plugin uses specific server code, we'll try our best to maintain compatibility, though issues may arise. If you find any plugin compatibility issues, feel free to make a support ticket and report the problems!

## "Can you include patches from Tuinity/Paper?"
Airplane is a fork of Tuinity, which itself is a fork of Paper. As such, Airplane contains all performance and gameplay optimizations from Paper and Tuinity.
